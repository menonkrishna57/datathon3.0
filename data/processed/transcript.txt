I was born of the ice and snow with the winter wolves in the dark alone the wildest night I became the one and you'll know your mind when the silence call heavy for the week Knife in my heart couldn't slow me down cause power is power my fire never goes out I rise from my scars nothing hurts me now cause power is power now watch me burning it down how do I ever know who can I trust? Feelings of emptiness only love could kill me God bless A knife in my heart couldn't slow me down cause power is power fire never goes out I rise from my scars nothing hurts me now Cuz power is power touch me burn it took a lot so I took it back dangers on my mind ain't no knife, dagger, bullet that can do it for you you know I go right I should do it A knife in my heart it could have sl me down power is power I down nothing hurts me watch me burn it down watch me burn it down.
